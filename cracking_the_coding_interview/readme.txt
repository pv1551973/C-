The following is a brief description of the organization of this directory hierarchy:
The file acronyms.txt contains expansions for acronyms, which represent subdirectory (level 2) names in this directory (level 1); each acronym corresponds to a particular chapter in 
the book CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW. For instance, the subdirectory (level 2) designated as "as" would pertain to any attempted problem listed under the corresponding chapter 
titled "Arrays and Strings" in the book.
Under each subdirectory (level 2), the file "reference.txt" provides both the corresponding number and the description of the specific problem attempted from the book chapter; 
each subdirectory (level 3) herein containing the relevant source code, has been designated in accordance with the specific problem number outlined in reference.txt.
